## If had more time/real feature
- Many more tests
- Wouldn't have used third-party libs for the Select componenent.
- Not accessible at all
- more robust API code


## Slight changes/assumptions
- Changed the proposed date picker to a simple month selector since the smallest unit the user can select is by month anyway
